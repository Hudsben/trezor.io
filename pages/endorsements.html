              {% blocktrans %} Trezor is a well designed, easy to use product with great support. I'd heartily recommend it to anyone who wishes to protect their digital investments. The willingness of the developers to accommodate digital currencies besides Bitcoin
              makes it even more valuable. I look forward to the expanding capabilities of this valuable tool. {% endblocktrans %}
